# Find It!

A single-page application to fetch information about archival objects in ArchivesSpace using refids.

## Requirements

Because the application makes HTTP using Javascript, CORS needs to be implemented on your ArchivesSpace instance. See [as-cors](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/as-cors) for an example of how to do this with an ArchivesSpace plugin.

## Installation

1.  Set up a config file, which should be named `app-config.js` and placed in the `js/` directory. It should look something like this:

        var baseUrl = "http://localhost:8089"; // Base url for your ArchivesSpace instance, including the backend port number
        var repoId = "2"; // ID for the repo you want to query against
        var token = "81ee42992541795ad7cee5b5701a632fd43a61831b1768cab88e921e3a983e27"; // Non-expiring session token for an AS user

To get a non-expiring session token, use a `expiring=false` parameter when making an [ArchivesSpace authentication request](http://archivesspace.github.io/archivesspace/api/#authentication).

## Usage

Open up `index.html`, drop a refid for an ArchivesSpace archival object or the full DIMES url for the object you'd like into the search box, click "find" or hit enter, and watch the magic happen!

If `Find It!` has trouble connecting to ArchivesSpace or logging you in, those errors will be displayed in the top right hand corner of the page.
